## DESCRIPTION

### Race Path is the ultimate tool for bringing a high level of racing immersion to your FiveM server. This script allows players to record, view, and save custom racing paths that visually track acceleration and braking with dynamic color-coded trails. RacePath is ideal for competitive events, practice runs, or simply enhancing a player’s experience by showing their path and speed changes in real time.

## FEATURES

* Real-time Path Tracking
    #### Track player paths in real-time, visualizing speed and braking dynamics with color-coded trails. The path adjusts colors based on acceleration or braking levels, giving an immediate visual aid for racing techniques and improving cornering precision.
* Customizable Display Modes
    #### Choose between multiple path display modes to highlight specific driving actions, showing only acceleration, only braking, or both together. This flexibility allows racers to focus on perfecting particular aspects of their driving style.
* Path Saving and Loading
    #### Players can save their recorded paths and access them later for comparison and review. Paths are saved in manageable chunks in a MySQL database, allowing for a smoother experience and unlimited saving possibilities.
